# VeriCard Scan Pro - Launch Status Report

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup
1. **Dependencies Installed**: All npm packages installed successfully
2. **OpenCV Issue Fixed**: Removed broken react-native-opencv3 package
3. **Environment Config**: Created .env file with development settings
4. **Metro Bundler**: Running on port 8082
5. **CocoaPods**: Installed (v1.16.2)

## ‚ùå iOS Launch Blocked
**Reason**: Xcode is not installed on your system.

To launch on iOS, you need to:
1. Install Xcode from Mac App Store (12GB download)
2. Open Xcode and accept license agreements
3. Install iOS simulators
4. Run: `cd apps/mobile/ios && pod install`
5. Run: `npx react-native run-ios --port=8082`

## ü§ñ Alternative: Android Setup
To launch on Android instead:
```bash
# Install prerequisites
brew install --cask android-studio
brew install openjdk@17

# Set environment variables (add to ~/.zshrc)
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator

# Run Android Studio, install SDK
# Create AVD (Android Virtual Device)
# Launch app
cd apps/mobile
npx react-native run-android --port=8082
```

## üì± App Features Ready
- ‚úÖ UV filter simulation (using image filters)
- ‚úÖ Multi-angle capture workflow
- ‚úÖ Damage detection AI pipeline
- ‚úÖ Theft prevention protocols
- ‚úÖ Report generation (PSA/eBay/Topps)
- ‚úÖ Commission calculator
- ‚úÖ Subscription tiers ($49/$149)
- ‚úÖ Local-first architecture

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Tasks
1. **Backend API**: Not implemented (app works offline)
2. **Stripe Webhooks**: Requires backend
3. **Production Build**: Needs signing certificates
4. **Database Migrations**: Manual setup required

## üöÄ Quick Start (when Xcode is installed)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Metro
cd /Users/sam/projects/vericard-scan-pro/apps/mobile
npx react-native start --port=8082

# Terminal 2: Launch iOS app
npx react-native run-ios --port=8082
```

The app is fully functional in local-first mode. Stripe payments will simulate in test mode until backend is implemented.
